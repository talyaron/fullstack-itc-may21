create a two-page app. 


in the first page, you will insert colors (using input: color), to a list of colors on the DOM. 


The user can delete a list item. 


If the user clicks on the color on the first page, she will redirect to a second page, where she will see a grid of squares with the specific color.




the main things here are:
1. figure out how to generate a functional delete button (CRUD?) on 1st page (now-19:50)
2. figure out how to generate a grid (maybe use the box asgmt I did/tal's example) with the color of my choice


the main stuff to troubleshoot: (19:50-20:20)
1. it did display on 1st page DOM but now it doesn't 
2. grid related stuff.


(20:20-21:00)
if there's time left:
-do grid in a nicer/cooler way
