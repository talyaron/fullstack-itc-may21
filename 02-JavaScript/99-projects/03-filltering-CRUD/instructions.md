create one page with data constructed of an array of objects (of your preferred subject)
show all objects on the DOM (responsively)

filter it with a select-option button

DELETE: each item can be deleted using a button on the bottom of the item.

UPDATE: The user can also edit the item name

CREATE: the user can create a new item

there will be a free search input text, to search within the items (I'll teach you to search on Friday) (RegEx)
