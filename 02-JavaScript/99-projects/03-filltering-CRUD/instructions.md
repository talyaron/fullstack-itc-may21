show all objects on the DOM (responsively)

CREATE: the user can create a new item

FILTER: filter it with a select-option button
    SEARCH: there will be a free search input text, to search within the items (I'll teach you to search on Friday) (RegEx)

UPDATE: The user can also edit the item name

DELETE: each item can be deleted using a button on the bottom of the item.
