<!--
    Create a Whatsapp application with two pages. 
1st page: the chatGroups
2nd page: chat

use classes, destructors, spread, typescript
use BEM model
make it look as similar as you can to the real Whatsapp

Work in a group.
start with the design of the classes, BEM


    brainstorming 

    Rsponsive


    search

    JSON/local storage
    first contacts pre-loaded (I don't know the word, but are the pre contact that we have when we refresh or open the page)
    I created a JASON with our contact in one typescript, then we call it in other typescript and render it. Here we use for each and create a method to render contacts

    filter

    Popup (modal window)
    we need to create one in the second page to add emojis, we can add 4 or 5 emojis and also the modal should be a buttom to pass emoji for the typing bar

    add a file: in the same conversation bar, next to the emojis, we need to create a file icon to add files

    typing bar: it is an common input with border radius like typing in whatsapp
