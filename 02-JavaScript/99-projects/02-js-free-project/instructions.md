choose a project that you like. you can take ideas from existing sites.
It should consist of at least 2 pages, that you can navigate between them (using href ot js redirect)
the user must enter data, and you share the data over the 2 screens.
for example, the user enter an image to a bank of images, and we see each image in a seprate page.

preferbly use OOP, or at least functional programing.
use scss, and make it beutiful.
use animations

use google if you dont know how to do things.
