    <h1>THE LION</h1>
    <h2>WHY ARE LIONS KING OF THE JUNGLE?</h2>
    <p>Lions live in Africa south of the Sahara and in Northwest India. Lions donâ€™t actually live in the jungle. Their real habitat is the open savanna where they hunt mammals such as gazelles, antelope, and zebra. They may also cooperate to catch larger mammals such as buffalo, giraffes and even crocodiles. Lionesses, or female lions, usually do most of the hunting. Sometimes they work together to flush out prey. One lion will scare out prey towards the others making it difficult to escape.</p>
