<!-- YS: If you will use 2 JS files, it is better to import only 1 (one source of truth). You can then import functions from one JS file to another. Look up importing functions in ES6.
    In this assignment it wasn't necessary to separate your JS into two files since you didn't have a lot functions and they were simple. But in general it is good to have different 
    functionalities separated (but only 1 linked in the HTML). Good job! -->
