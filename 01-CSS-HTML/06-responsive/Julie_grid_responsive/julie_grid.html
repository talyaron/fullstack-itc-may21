            I am a historian with an interest in the weird religions of the
            nineteenth-century. I am currently writing a book about Helena
            Blavatsky's work,
            <em>The Voice of the Silence</em>

            Helena Blavatsky was the founder of the Theosophical Society and the
            "great-grandmother" of the New Age Movement. I wrote my PhD on her.

            My 2019 book,
            <em> Recycled Lives</em> was a historical study of Blavatsky's
            theory of reincarnation. This theory is more influential today than
            many people realise.
