               <h3>Covid: China hits back as US revisits Wuhan lab-leak theory</h3>
               <p>China has denounced US efforts to further investigate whether Covid-19 came from a Chinese lab.

                  US President Joe Biden has said he expects to release the results of an intelligence report on the origins of the virus.
                  
                  China's foreign ministry accused the US of "political manipulation and blame shifting".
                  
                  It has rejected any link between Covid-19 and a virus research lab in the Chinese city of Wuhan.</p>
