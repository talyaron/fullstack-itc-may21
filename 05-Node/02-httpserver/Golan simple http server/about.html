        <h1>More about me</h1>
        <p>I was born in Kiev, Ukraine, in 1987 - not a whole lot of time before the Soviet Union fell apart. 
            <br>My family made Aliyah when I was just 3 years old, and we lived in Tel Aviv for about two years. 
            <br>Then, we moved to Yavne (near Rehovot and Ashdod), where I grew up. 
            <br>After my army service I moved to Bat Yam, where I worked with at risk youth as head of the local music division at an NGO called "Elem". 
            <br>After Bat-Yam, I lived in Yafo (near the beach!) for just a bit more than a year, and them finally came back to Tel Aviv.
            <br> I left Tel aviv for Givatayim just a month ago, but I don't know if that actually counts as moving to a different city :)</p>
